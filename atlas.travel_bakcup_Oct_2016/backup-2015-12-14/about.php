<p><span class="sub_span_orange">History</span>

Atlas Travel was founded in 1994 in Toronto, Canada offering flights and packages to Europe, the Middle 

East and across North America. In the year 2000, the company expanded again by opening up its 

wholesaler arm as an Airline Ticketing consolidator.</p>
<p>Atlas Travel was among the first travel agencies to evolve its distribution channel with the growing 

online retail marketplace. In 2002, we launched www.Atlas.Travel online as a destination to search, 

book, and purchase a line of travel products.  Once again, sales dramatically increased. In order to better 

service our clients, in 2004 Atlas Travel invested again in its online business and introduced a state of the 

art booking technology that provides fast and reliable travel searches, along with 24/7 online customer 

service. Today, we continue to grow, evolve and upgrade our technology so that we can be the best 

online travel website to our customers. We’ve earned the trust and respect in the industry and we fight 

for our clients’ satisfaction. Our commitment to our customers has been the driver of Atlas Travel’s 

success and will no doubt continue to be throughout the years.</p>
