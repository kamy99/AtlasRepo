                        <p>Unforeseeable emergencies happen and can be extremely expensive. Provincial health insurance plans and other insurance such as homeowners', employee group benefits and credit cards may not adequately provide the coverage required to safeguard you on your trip.
</p>
                        <p>Lost luggage and unexpected emergencies back home are common travel problems which are seamlessly resolved with the purchase of Travel Guard insurance plans.

</p>
                        <p>Travel insurance isn't just for emergency medical situations while you are on your trip. When reviewing the coverage for your insurance you should also consider insuring the cost of your trip with Trip Cancellation Insurance because emergencies can happen before you leave.

                    <h2>The following real-life scenarios demonstrate the necessity of purchasing travel insurance.</h2>

                    <h3>Medical Emergency:</h3>
                    <p>A 50-year old woman collapses aboard a cruise ship in the Caribbean. The ship's doctor recommends she be taken to the nearest island hospital at the next port of call where very little English is spoken. The hospital expenses, emergency air ambulance home and additional emergency air transportation home for her family members cost $50,000. The lost portion of the pre-paid cruise is valued at $10,000. Her provincial health insurance plan only reimburses $2,000. With trip interruption and emergency accident and sickness benefits offered through Travel Guard, not only were all these expenses and losses covered, our multi-lingual emergency assistance counselors worked with the attending physician and family physician to organize the best possible care, air ambulance, family transportation and the securing of a hospital bed back home. Additionally, all medical bills were paid directly to the various medical suppliers by Travel Guard.</p>
                    <h3>Trip Cancellation:</h3>
                    <p>A family totally prepays a tour package to Orlando, Florida which includes return flights, hotel accommodation and day passes to a theme resort; total cost: $12,000. Two days before their departure date, the father was hospitalized following a car accident. Since the trip was only cancelled two days prior to departure, the cancellation charge by the tour operator was 100% of the holiday cost. In preparation for their trip they purchased Travel Guard's Deluxe Trip Cancellation and Interruption Package insurance - the total insured amount was refunded including the cost of the theme resort day passes.</p>
                    <h3>Trip Interruption:</h3>
                    <p>Honeymooners purchase air tickets to Vancouver and an Alaskan cruise. Their flight arrival from Montreal was delayed by weather and they missed their cruise departure. Without travel insurance, the honeymooners would have to find and pay their own way home or find a way to catch up to the cruise ship. With Travel Guard's Trip Interruption coverage offered through Deluxe Trip Cancellation and Interruption Package, emergency travel assistance was one phone call away. Hotel arrangements and/or arrangements to catch up to the cruise ship or return home are handled by Travel Guard Travel Assist and the transportation costs and the value of the lost days at sea would be reimbursable.</p>
                    <h3>Lost Travel Documents:</h3>
                    <p>While visiting relatives in Spain, a senior citizen lost her passport and travel tickets. Without insurance, she would have to deal with the foreign language issue and figure out how to get a new passport and replacement airline tickets. Exclusively through Travel Guard, one call to LivetravelT 24/7 emergency travel assistance number all the phone calls, negotiations and arrangements for new documents were completed and all documentation was sent to her. </p>
