There are many reasons a card can be declined. Some problems include: incorrect card number, expiry date or security code, or insufficient funds, low daily spending limit, failed billing address verification and internet fraud screening. Please note that in most cases the airline will only allow the ticketing on the same day before the fare expires and the reservation is canceled. You will be also notified if your card is declined during the ticketing and you will have to contact the credit card company to clear up the problem. Once the problem is resolved you can call our call center to issue your ticket, if the fare still is available.

A child is considered an infant from 0-24 months. You may travel with your infant in your lap.  A separate ticket is required for every infant whether it’s in the guardians lap or in a separate seat. Depending on the destination, the airline may offer a discounted fare for the infant.

When an adult travels with 2 infants, the adult may only hold ONE infant. An additional seat at the adult fare must be purchased for the 2nd infant and may require another adult.

 You may be required to provide proof of parent and guardian (such as a birth certificate or passport) at the airport for any children.

There are many reasons a card can be declined. Some problems include: insufficient funds, low daily spending limit, failed billing address verification and internet fraud screening. Please note that in most cases the airline will only allow a flight request to hold on the same day before the fare expires and the request is canceled. You will be notified if your card is declined and you will have to contact the credit card company to clear up the problem. Once the problem is resolved you can call our call center.

We distinguished the Canadian and U.S pages and fares to offer better deals and better discounts of each region based on local and more competitive rates.

If you find a better deal in the Atlas Canadian page or vise versa, the amount will be converted to Canadian dollars and these amounts are what will appear on your billing statements. Since the currency exchange rate is based on your credit card company’s conversion rate tool at the time your charge is processed, your final amount may vary.

Please contact our Atlas Travel sales office for more information. 

Occasionally, some airline’s fare rules do not permit to charge the ticket fees once to issue the ticket. Accordingly we have no choice to charge the total fee in 2 parts.

Refund minus refund fee will be made to the original credit card, which has paid for the ticket. Airlines do not permit the refund under any other person or any other credit card or cash payment. If the original payment was cash or e-transfer, Atlas Travel will issue a cheque to the passenger. If a ticket has been paid for by a person other than the passenger named in the ticket, and his/her name is in the invoice, Atlas Travel shall make a refund cheque only to the person paying for the ticket or to that person's order.
